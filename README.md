Beyond Rules: The Collatz Conjecture as a Litmus Test
The Collatz conjecture presents a crucial test case. The rule is simple ("if even, divide by 2; if odd, multiply by 3 and add 1"), and therefore, the Kolmogorov complexity of its generated history, K(H), is low, regardless of how chaotic the sequence appears. A filter based on the environmental complexity K(H) alone would fail to suppress a "Collatz World."
This analysis, however, is incomplete as it ignores the observer, Φ. The true filter becomes apparent when we consider the complexity of the entire observer-history system (Φ-H), upon which the CAP prior P ∝ 2⁻ᶜ acts. Using the chain rule of algorithmic complexity, the total cost of the system is:
K(Φ, H) ≈ K(H) + K(Φ | H)
K(H) is the complexity of the environment's rules (which is low for Collatz).
K(Φ | H) is the conditional complexity of the observer given that environment.
For an observer Φ to exist—to form a model of its past, make predictions, or maintain a stable identity in a "Chaotic Collatz World"—its cognition would need to be immensely complex. Thus, for a chaotic history H_collatz, the K(Φ | H_collatz) term would be astronomically high, making the total system complexity K(Φ, H) prohibitive. This is a direct application of the Upper Bound: complex Φ-H systems are excluded even if their environmental rules H are simple.
In contrast, our reality is characterized by lawful regularities that permit the existence of low-complexity observers. Our minds operate on compressed models, simple heuristics, and assumptions of continuity. The conditional complexity K(Φ | H_our_world) is therefore comparatively tiny, leading to a low total system complexity.
Finally, even "Simple Collatz Worlds" (e.g., starting with n = 2¹⁰⁰⁰) are ruled out. Such universes fail the Lower Bound defined by the Observer-Centered Conditions (QC & SCP). They lack the necessary substrate complexity—the rich interplay of components and forces—required to physically instantiate an information-processing pattern as complex as Φ in the first place.
